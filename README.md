With this multi-auth system, both users and admins will have their own dedicated dashboards. We'll also go through the registration process for users, while for admins, we'll focus solely on the login area. Throughout the tutorial, you'll learn how to create middleware and how to effectively use them. We'll cover concepts like guest middleware and authenticated middleware, giving you a comprehensive understanding of Laravel's authentication mechanisms.
